LUH Implementation of the SIG NIP Plugin for the collection of Plugin information from ILIAS Installations

This Plugin is intended to collect information from an ILIAS installation to facilitate the work of the Special Interest Group "Nachhaltige ILIAS Plugins (NIP)" (Sustainable ILIAS Plugins) of the ILIAS Community. The SIG NIP cares about creating better means and processes to keep plugins for ILIAS up to date and alive.

The idea is to install this plugin in Higher Education Institutions and enable it to send back information to the SIG, like eg the list of installed plugins. This will be helpful to gain more insight information for the SIG NIP.
